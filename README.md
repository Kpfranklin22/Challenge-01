## Description

This was the first exercise in On-the-job tickets. The exercise is about reading User Story and Acceptance criteria, and being able to extrapolate the necessary information and implement the changes to optimize the example website. Examples of optimizing the website include: making sure links work, make sure semantic elements are present, consolodating CSS, etc.
